# Airport Simulator
Author- Bartosz Pogoda

That's just my project for my Object Oriented Programming classes. First project using github.

Update 20.11.2016: Now after some time passed I see how messy was the code I wrote. Even though everything is working fine the application is really hard to make some changes in, implement some new features etc. It is mainy because the model and view code is mixed inside of most of the classes. I guess I've broken all the software development rules, but that was a good lesson. Now I'm working on some projects with better (planned) architecture, mostly MVC-like ones.
